# Sudoku-Project

This is my final project for Programming Fundamentals 1 at the University of Flordia. It is important to note that this project was a group assigment and I completed it with the help of three other students. The goal of the assigment was to code Sudoku using pygame and other skills obtained throughout the semester.
